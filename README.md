This code is written for a microcontroller (specifically the TM4C1294NCPDT) and implements a program where LEDs flash in specific patterns based on button presses. Here's a summary of what it does:

The program configures GPIO ports N, F, and J for use with LEDs and switches. Port N controls two LEDs (D1 and D2), and Port F controls two LEDs (D3 and D4). Port J is used to read input from two switches (SW1 and SW2). The switches are configured with a weak pull-up resistor to ensure stable input states. In the main loop, the program continuously checks the state of the switches. Depending on the switch state, different LED patterns are displayed:

When SW1 is pressed, D1 and D2 alternate.
When SW2 is pressed, D3 and D4 alternate.
When both switches are pressed simultaneously, all four LEDs alternate in pairs (D1/D3 and D2/D4). Delays are implemented using loops to make the LED transitions visually perceivable. The program keeps looping until it's manually stopped.
